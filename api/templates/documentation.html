	<h1> Movie Theme Song Database </h1>
	<p> Movie Theme Song Database is a database filled with movies and theme songs. Each theme song is associated with a movie and each movie can have any number of theme songs.</p>
	<p> There are two ways to access the data in the database; the first way is through the <a href='#gi'>graphical interface</a> and the second way is by using the <a href='#api'>API endpoints</a>. </p>

	<h2 id='gi'> Graphical interface </h2>
	<p> The web service is not yet deployed so when the application is run on your own machine the base url is <a href='http://localhost:5000/'>localhost:5000/</a>  (or another specified port).</p>
	<p> The graphical interface is the only way to add or delete data from the database, but you can access the data with the <a href="#api">API endpoints</a> as well. The data can be accessed, deleted and created without any authentication.</p>
	<h3> Movies </h3>
  <p> The main page is at <a href='/movies'>/movies</a> and contains a list of movies which can be clicked. At the top of the page is a form which can be filled in to add a new movie to the database. Each movie needs to be associated with an IMDB id, which can be seen in the URL of movies on the <a href='https://www.imdb.com'>IMDB website</a>. E.g. <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/'>www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/</a> where <strong>tt0120737</strong> is the id.</p>
	
  <h3 id='themes'> Themes </h3>
  <p> Each movie has it's own page <b>/movies/<i>id</i></b> (id is this web service's own id)  where <i>id</i>, <i>title</i>, <i>IMDB id</i> and a list of theme songs can be viewed. The movie can be deleted with the button at the bottom of the page. Deleting a movie will also delete all of it's associated theme songs. A new theme song can be added by filling out the form at the bottom of the theme songs list. Each theme song needs a title, composer and a spotify id. The spotify id is used in spotify URIs to identify a specific song. E.g. <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZSf1TJZyRb0rnWYuUtdX4'>https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZSf1TJZyRb0rnWYuUtdX4</a> where <strong>3ZSf1TJZyRb0rnWYuUtdX4</strong> is the id.
	<p> An individual theme can be accessed by clicking on it. It has the url <b>/theme/<i>id</i></b>. A theme page contains <i>id</i>, <i>title</i> and <i>spotify id</i>. A theme can be deleted by pressing the button at the bottom of the page.</p>
	<h3> Note </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> The id for accessing movies and themes is only used for navigation and access on the website and has no other use. </li>
		<li> Movies or themes can't be added through a url but must be added through the forms. </li>
		<li> Movies or themes can be deleted through a POST request to <b>/delete/<i>id</i></b> or <b>/theme/delete/<i>id</i></b>, but is preferably deleted through the graphical interface (or not at all).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id='api'> API endpoints </h2>
	<p> This application provides a number of different endpoint for accessing the data in the database in different ways. The data can only be read, not created, updated or deleted through the api calls. If you wish to add or delete data, see the <a href=#gi>Graphical interface</a> section. All data are recieved as JSON files.</p>
	<p> Whenever <i>id</i> or any other part of the url is written in cursive, it should be substituted for a positive integer. See each specific endpoint for more information.</p>
	<p> The base adress for api calls are <a href='/api/v1'>/api/v1</a>

  <h3>Code example</h3>
  <p> The following example uses one of the APIs endpoints; <a href='#random'>GET /themes/random</a>. It is written in JavaScript in the React framework, but any language which can handle API calls and JSON objects can use the API in a similar way.</p>
  <p>The method in this example fetches a two-dimensional array of random theme objects from the web service, it stores some data from the first element of each inner array as answer and some other data from all the elements of each inner array as options, then shuffles the options and stores both variables in a global array. This is reapeated for each inner array.</p>
  <p>First the API must be called which is done here on line 2 with the fetch function. This endpoint needs two query parameters in the URL. The response is stored in a variable. The API response is a JSON file, but it has to be 'converted' for Javascript to know that it should interpret it as such - line 3.</p>
  <p>Since the JSON response consist of a nested list/array, the elements (theme objects) can be accessed as a normal JavaScript two-dimensional array, by specifying the wanted indexes – line 8. The parameters of a theme object can be accessed as a normal JavaScript object - lines 11-15.</p>
  <p>Theme object parameters can also be accessed directly from the JSON file – lines 20-21.</p>
  <pre><code>
1  async fetchQuizData(nbrOfQuestions, nbrOfOptions) {
2    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/v1/themes/random
       ?questions=${nbrOfQuestions}&options=${nbrOfOptions}`);
3    const json = await response.json();
4
5    let answer = '';
6    for (let i = 0; i < json.length; i++) {
7      const options = [];
8      const current = json[i][0];
9
10     answer = {
11       title: current['movie title'],
12       spotify: current['spotify'],
13       song: current['title'],
14       composer: current['composer'],
15       correct: false,
16     };
17
18     for (let j = 0; j < json[i].length; j++) {
19       options.push({
20         'movie title': json[i][j]['movie title'],
21         imdb: json[i][j]['imdb'],
22       });
23     }
24
25     shuffle(options);
26     addToQuizData(options, answer);
27   }

29   this.setState({ spotifyId: quizData[0].answer.spotify });
